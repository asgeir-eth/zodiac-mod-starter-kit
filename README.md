# Zodiac Mod Starter Kit

A starter kit for creating Zodiac Modules and Modifiers.

The repo contains a sample based on the "Zodiac: build your own module" tutorial found [here](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-build-a-module/setup).

## Commands

It is set up to be used with Hardhat. To see available commands run `yarn hardhat`.

Some helpful commands:

```
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn hardhat deploy # compiles and deploys the contracts add the `--network` param to select a network
yarn hardhat test # runs the tests
```

## Attache your module to a Gnosis Safe

Once you have created a module and want to add it to a Gnosis Safe:

1. In the Gnosis Safe app, navigate to the "apps" tab and select the Zodiac Safe App.
2. Select "custom module", enter the address of your newly deployed module, and hit "Add Module".

It will then show up under Modules and Modifiers in the Gnosis Safe's Zodiac app.
